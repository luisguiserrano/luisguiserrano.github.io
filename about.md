	<h1 class="pageTitle">About Luis Serrano</h1>
	<p class="intro">Hi! I'm Luis.</p>
	<p>Welcome to my blog about Math, Machine Learning, and Education. </p>
	<p>A brief story of my life. I am currently the Content Lead of Artificial Intelligence at <a href = "http://udacity.com">Udacity</a>. Before this, I was a Machine Learning Engineer at Google, where I worked in the video recommendations team at YouTube. Before this, I was a research mathematician, I did a Bachelors and Masters at the <a href = "http://www.uwaterloo.ca">University of Waterloo</a>, a PhD at the <a href = "http://www.umich.edu">University of Michigan</a>, and an NSERC Postdoctoral Fellowship at the <a href = "http://www.uqam.ca">University of Quebec at Montreal</a>. Back in the wee days as a high school student, I participated in the <a href = "https://www.imo-official.org/">International Mathematical Olympiads</a>, representing my native country of Colombia in the IMO 98 and IMO 99.</p>
